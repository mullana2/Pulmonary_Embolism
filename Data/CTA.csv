The preliminary report did notinclude the findings of pseudoaneurysm near the surgical repairsite in the ascending aorta. This was added to the report.Additionally I have some comments on the above study as below. Postop changes of graft repair of the ascending aorta is appreciated.Adjacent to the surgical graft site near the aortic root is a smalloutpouching of contrast seen between the graft repair and the mainpulmonary artery. It seems to be connected to the aortic lumen on the3-D reconstructions. No mass effect on the surrounding structures.There is small amount of mediastinal fluid but no definite fluidcollections appreciated. Small amount of pneumomediastinum is likelyrelated to the presence of tubes in the mediastinum.Tiny amount of pneumoperitoneum is likely postsurgical. Mildhepatomegaly noted. Small amount of fluid is probably secondary to therecent surgery. Small amount of hemorrhage may be present in the pouchof Douglas behind the gravid uterus. No active extravasation ofcontrast seen. In the anterior abdominal wall, a small focalherniation of fat and fluid is seen within the subcutaneous fat to theleft of the surgical site, best seen on image 5-592. This herniationdoes not appear to contain bowel.The known aortic dissection is now much better visualized and isextending through the entire abdominal aorta, extending up to theorigin of the left external iliac artery and into the right commoniliac artery. The branch vessels of the aorta are well-opacified.There is no sign of mesenteric ischemia. Both the renal arteries arealso well-opacified with contrast.We also discussed that the significant bilateral lower lobe lungconsolidation/atelectasis is less conspicuous on the radiograph due toits retrocardiac location. Improving aeration in the lower lobes mighthelp with the right heart strain.All these additional findings were discussed with Dr. Sunder Krishnanin the CVICU and Dr. Sharon Larson in cardiothoracic surgery by Dr.Laroy at 0858 hours.
